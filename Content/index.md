# Set partitions

In this website are resources on counting set partitions and related structures. If there is something missing, contact me at jpbotelho.costa (at) gmail.com

## Number of partitions

- With no restrictions [**-> Bell Number**](bellNumbers.md)

- With exactly $n$ blocks [**-> Stirling Number of the second kind**](stirlingNumbers.md)
    - ...and at least $k$ elements per block **-> Associated Stirling Number of the second kind**
    - ...and at most $k$ elements per block **-> Restricted Stirling  Number of the second kind**
    - ...and the first $k$ elements are in separate blocks **--> r-Restricted Stirling Number of the second kind**
    - ...and consecutive elements are in separate blocks **-> Reduced Stirling Number of the second kind**

- With at least $k$ elements per block **-> Associated Bell Number**
- With at most $k$ elements per block **-> Restricted Bell Number**
- Such that the first $k$ elements are in separate blocks **-> r-Restricted Bell Number**

- Into $k$ nonempty linearly ordered subsets **-> Lah numbers**

- Non-crossing partitions **-> Catalan Number**



In general, the Bell Numbers are the sum of the Stirling Numbers, for all possible values of $n$.

## Extra
- Number of blocks of size $n$
