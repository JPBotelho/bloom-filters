# Set partitions

In this website are resources on counting set partitions and related structures. If there is something missing, contact me at jpbotelho.costa (at) gmail.com

## Number of partitions

- With no restrictions [**-> Bell Number**](bellNumbers.md)

- With exactly $n$ blocks [**-> Stirling Number of the second kind**](stirlingNumbers.md)
    - ...and at least $k$ elements per block **-> Associated Stirling Number of the second kind**
    - ...and at most $k$ elements per block **-> Restricted Stirling  Number of the second kind**
    - ...and the first $k$ elements are in separate blocks **--> r-Restricted Stirling Number of the second kind**
    - ...and consecutive elements are in separate blocks **-> Reduced Stirling Number of the second kind** 
    

- With at least $k$ elements per block **-> Associated Bell Number**
  - With at least $p$ elements per block, and the largest block has exactly $j$ elements [**-> stackoverflow**](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1078391/counting-set-partitions-with-constraints)
- With at most $k$ elements per block **-> Restricted Bell Number**
- Such that the first $k$ elements are in separate blocks **-> r-Restricted Bell Number**

- ?Into $k$ linearly ordered subsets [**-> Lah numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lah_number)

- ?Into $k$ weakly ordered subsets [**-> Ordered Bell / Fubini numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_Bell_number)

- Into non-crossing partitions **-> Catalan Number**

- With block lengths given by the $k$th integer partition of the number of elements [**-> A036040**](https://oeis.org/A036040)

- Into blocks of equal size [**-> A038041**](https://oeis.org/A038041)

- Into blocks of different sizes [**-> A007837**](https://oeis.org/A007837)
- Such that the smallest block has size $k$ [**-> A182930**](https://oeis.org/A182930)



#### Parity Restrictions [1]
Number of set partitions with...
- Odd block size [**-> A003724**](https://oeis.org/A003724)
- Even block size [**-> A005046**](https://oeis.org/A005046)
- Odd number of blocks [**-> A024429**](https://oeis.org/A024429)
- Even number of blocks [**-> A024430**](https://oeis.org/A024430)
- Odd number of blocks, odd block size [**-> A003712**](https://oeis.org/A003712)
- Odd number of blocks, even block size [**-> A059385**](https://oeis.org/A059385)
- Even number of blocks, odd block size [**-> A003709**](https://oeis.org/A003709)
- Even number of blocks, even block size [**-> A059386**](https://oeis.org/A059386)

others

- Number of set partitions with an even number of parts, minus the number of partitions with an odd number of parts [**-> A000587**](https://oeis.org/A000587)


## Extra
- Number of blocks of size $n$
